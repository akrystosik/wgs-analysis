# Reference Population Projection Analysis Report
============================================================

## Overview
Analysis projects ADNI samples onto reference population PC space
using MAGE samples with known 1000 Genomes ancestry as references.

## Reference Population Composition
- AFR: 196 samples (26.8%)
- EUR: 142 samples (19.4%)
- EAS: 141 samples (19.3%)
- SAS: 139 samples (19.0%)
- AMR: 113 samples (15.5%)

## Projection Results
- Total samples: 2,331
- Reference samples: 712 (30.5%)
- Projected samples: 0 (0.0%)

## Confidence Metrics

## Methodology
- Reference populations: MAGE samples with 1000 Genomes ancestry
- Projection method: K-Nearest Neighbors + Random Forest ensemble
- Feature space: Top 20 principal components
- Confidence threshold: 70% for high-confidence predictions
- Consensus rule: Use KNN if confidence >70%, else RF if confidence >70%
