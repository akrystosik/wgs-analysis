# Updated Metadata Schema Report
==================================================

## Schema Overview
This updated schema distinguishes between:
- **Self-reported ethnicity**: From clinical/survey data
- **Genomic ancestry**: Inferred from genetic analysis
- **Population assignment**: From reference projection

## Sample Composition
- Total samples: 20,941

### By Data Source
- GTEx: 19,553 (93.4%)
- MAGE: 731 (3.5%)
- ADNI: 650 (3.1%)
- ENCODE: 6 (0.0%)
- Unknown: 1 (0.0%)

### By Sample Type
- tissue: 20,284 (96.9%)
- blood: 651 (3.1%)
- cell_line: 6 (0.0%)

## Ethnicity vs Ancestry

### Self-Reported Ethnicity
