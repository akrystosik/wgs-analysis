## Whole Genome Sequencing and Variant Calling

### WGS Data Sources and Processing

ENCODE Project whole genome sequencing data comprised paired-end Illumina reads from nine immortalized cell lines: A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), Caki2 (renal carcinoma), GM23248 (lymphoblastoid), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), NCI-H460 (lung carcinoma), Panc1 (pancreatic carcinoma), T47D (breast adenocarcinoma), and SK-N-MC (neuroepithelioma). Raw FASTQ files were processed through comprehensive quality control and alignment pipelines using the GRCh38 reference genome (GCA_000001405.15).

### Preprocessing and Alignment

Quality assessment employed FastQC v0.11.9 with parallel processing (16 threads, 16GB memory per process). Alignment utilized BWA-MEM v0.7.17 configured for optimal performance (64 threads, 128GB memory) against the GRCh38 no-alt analysis set. Post-alignment processing followed GATK best practices including duplicate marking with Picard (64GB memory allocation) and comprehensive quality control using custom BAM QC metrics (coverage, alignment statistics, insert size distributions).

### Variant Calling Pipeline

Germline variant discovery employed Google DeepVariant v1.6.0 configured for whole genome sequencing with optimized computational parameters (64 shards, WGS model). Somatic variant detection utilized Google DeepSomatic v1.6.0 in tumor-only mode (WGS_TUMOR_ONLY model, 64 shards) accounting for cell line characteristics and absence of matched normal samples.

The pipeline implemented parallel processing with make_examples, call_variants, and postprocess_variants stages distributed across 64 computational shards. Final variant sets were filtered using each caller's internal quality assessment: DeepVariant PASS variants for germline calls and DeepSomatic PASS variants for somatic calls, leveraging the machine learning models' integrated quality control rather than hard filtering thresholds.

### Combined Germline and Somatic Variant Integration

Cancer cell line analysis required specialized handling to distinguish inherited germline variants from acquired somatic mutations without matched normal samples. We implemented a sophisticated dual-caller integration strategy leveraging the complementary strengths of DeepVariant and DeepSomatic.

**Variant Classification Strategy**: DeepVariant calls were used as the primary source for high-confidence germline variants due to its specialized training on population-scale germline variation. DeepSomatic provided both somatic variant calls (PASS filter) and additional germline classifications (GERMLINE filter) using tumor-only mode, with the model's internal population frequency assessment contributing to variant classification.

**Integration Methodology**: We extracted GERMLINE-labeled variants from DeepSomatic and intersected them with DeepVariant calls to create a high-confidence germline set. This intersection approach achieved 96% concordance for variants with variant allele frequency (VAF) 0.4-0.6, validating our germline classification strategy. Non-overlapping DeepVariant calls were retained as additional germline variants, while DeepSomatic PASS variants were preserved as potential somatic mutations.

**Final Combined Dataset Creation**: The final variant set combined: (1) DeepVariant PASS variants at positions without DeepSomatic PASS calls (germline variants), and (2) DeepSomatic PASS variants (somatic variants). This position-based deduplication strategy produced comprehensive variant catalogs averaging 4.9 million variants per cell line while maintaining clear provenance of variant origins and preventing caller overlap.

**Validation Against Reference Data**: Combined variant sets were validated against published ENCODE variant calls and GTEx population data. Cell lines showed elevated variant counts compared to GTEx samples (4.9M vs 3.5M average), with particularly increased indel frequencies (896K vs 260K average), consistent with genomic instability in immortalized cancer cell lines. Cross-sample validation confirmed systematic differences between cancer cell lines and normal population samples, supporting the biological relevance of our dual-caller approach.

### Quality Control and Validation

Comprehensive quality metrics were generated using bcftools stats with systematic evaluation across all cell lines. Variant quality control relied on the machine learning models' internal assessment (PASS filters) rather than hard filtering thresholds, leveraging DeepVariant and DeepSomatic's sophisticated quality evaluation frameworks. Cell line-specific validation compared results against published ENCODE variant datasets where available.

Pipeline monitoring utilized custom JSON-based tracking systems with real-time resource usage assessment and automated error detection. All processing included complete provenance tracking with timestamped logs and computational resource utilization metrics.

### Computational Infrastructure

Processing employed high-performance computing infrastructure with optimized resource allocation: 96-core systems with 256GB RAM for variant calling, distributed processing across 64 computational shards, and containerized execution ensuring reproducible results. The complete pipeline was orchestrated using Python-based workflow management with comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.

### Data Products and Results

The pipeline generated high-quality variant calls for all nine cell lines with substantial genomic diversity. Final datasets comprised 3.4-8.4 million germline variants per cell line (mean 4.9 million) and additional somatic variant calls with tumor-only filtering. Variant annotation included functional consequences, population frequencies, and pathogenicity predictions using comprehensive reference databases.

Output formats included standard VCF files with tabix indexing, GVCF files for population-scale analysis, and detailed quality control reports with visual summaries. All variant calls achieved >99% successful annotation rates with comprehensive functional classification and population frequency annotation.

### Integration with Transcriptomic Data

Variant calls were systematically integrated with corresponding RNA-seq expression profiles from the same cell lines to enable comprehensive multi-omics analysis. This integration framework supported allele-specific expression analysis, variant-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) detection, and functional consequence assessment of genomic variants on gene expression patterns.
