#### 1.1 **Optimize VCF Extraction**
- [ ] **Install bcftools/tabix** for efficient VCF processing
  - `sudo apt-get install bcftools tabix` or use conda

- [ ] **Extract larger variant sets** (5K-10K variants)
  - Use: `bcftools view -r chr1,chr2,chr22 | head -15000`
  - Target: 5,000-10,000 high-quality variants
- [ ] **Implement parallel chromosome processing**
  - Extract chr1, chr2, chr22 separately
  - Combine results for comprehensive analysis

#### 1.2 **Improve Ancestry Mapping**
- [ ] **Investigate low mapping rate** (31.4%)
  - Check sample ID formats in VCF vs ancestry files
  - Look for additional ancestry sources
  - Consider sample ID transformations (NA12345 â†’ HG12345)
- [ ] **Add GTEx ancestry data** if available
  - Check if GTEx samples have ancestry assignments
  - Integrate with MAGE data for broader coverage

#### 1.3 **Enhanced Analysis Features**
- [ ] **Add LD pruning** to remove correlated variants
  - Filter variants by distance (e.g., one per 10kb)
  - Calculate rÂ² between variants
- [ ] **MAF filtering optimization**
  - Current: MAF â‰¥ 0.01 (already applied)
  - Consider MAF â‰¥ 0.05 for more informative variants
- [ ] **Add quality filters**
  - Filter by variant quality scores
  - Remove variants with high missing rates

### **Priority 2: Production Scaling (1 week)**

  - Population clustering dendrograms
  - Geographic projection if coordinates available
- [ ] **Comparison with literature**
  - Overlay with 1000 Genomes Project PCA
  - Compare with published MAGE analyses

### **Priority 3: Advanced Analysis (2-3 weeks)**

#### 3.1 **Statistical Enhancements**
- [ ] **UMAP/t-SNE** for non-linear dimensionality reduction
  - Compare with linear PCA results
  - Better separation of closely related populations
- [ ] **Ancestry inference algorithms**
  - Implement ADMIXTURE or fastSTRUCTURE
  - Estimate individual ancestry proportions
- [ ] **Population genetic statistics**
  - FST calculations between populations
  - Nucleotide diversity within populations
  - Linkage disequilibrium patterns

#### 3.2 **Integration with RNA-seq**
- [ ] **Compare VCF PCA with RNA-seq PCA**
  - Same samples, different data types
  - Correlation between genetic and expression structure
- [ ] **Identify population-specific expression patterns**
